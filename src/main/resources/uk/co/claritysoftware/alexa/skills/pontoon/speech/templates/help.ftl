Welcome to Pontoon.
</#if>
Pontoon is a card game where the objective is to finish the game with a hand score as close to 21, without going over 21.
<#if gameAlreadyStarted>
Your game is already started, so you can 'twist' or 'stick'.
<#else>
To start the game, say 'start a game'. If you want ace to be high, start the game by saying 'start a game with aces high'.
When the game starts I will deal you a hand of 2 cards. I will tell you your hand and score, and you can choose to 'twist' or 'stick'.
</#if>
If you stick, that is the end of your game.
If you twist, I will deal you another card, but beware as the new card may take your score over 21, in which case you are bust and you lose!
